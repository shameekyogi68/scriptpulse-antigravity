INT. SAFE HOUSE – NIGHT

Rain hits the broken window. A single bulb flickers.

MAYA sits at the table, assembling a handgun with shaking hands.

RAJ
You checked the exits?

MAYA
Three times.

A loud THUD upstairs.

They freeze.

RAJ
That wasn’t the wind.

Silence. Long. Heavy.

A floorboard creaks.

CUT TO:

INT. STAIRCASE – CONTINUOUS

Footsteps. Slow. Deliberate.

UNKNOWN VOICE (O.S.)
You should not be here.

MAYA runs.

RAJ flips the table and fires twice.

Glass shatters. Smoke. Screaming.

CUT TO:

EXT. SAFE HOUSE – NIGHT

Police lights explode across the trees.

Ten officers rush in different directions shouting conflicting orders.

COMMANDER
Split! North and east perimeter! Move!

Everyone talks at once.

Radio chatter overlaps.

CUT TO:

INT. SAFE HOUSE – LATER

Quiet.

MAYA sits alone.

Gun unloaded.

Hands still shaking.

No dialogue.
