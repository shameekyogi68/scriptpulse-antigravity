EXT. MEADOW - DAY

The sun shines brightly. Birds chirp in the trees. A gentle breeze blows through the flowers. Everything is peaceful and calm.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

A student reads a book. The room is quiet. Dust motes dance in the light. Safe and secure.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

Explosions everywhere! Soldiers scream in pain. Blood soaks the ground. Machine gun fire rips through the air. A tank crushed the wall.

INT. BURNING BUILDING - NIGHT

Fire consumes the room. Smoke fills the lungs. We are trapped! The roof is collapsing. There is no escape. Help us! Death is imminent.

EXT. MEADOW - DAY

The sun shines again. The war is over. Peace returns. A gentle breeze.
