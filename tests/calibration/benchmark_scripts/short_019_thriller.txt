EXT. BEACH - DAWN

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across CHEN's face.

LILY
(quietly)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. PRIYA rubs tired eyes.

LILY
(sighs)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

CHEN enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

PRIYA
(quietly)
Who sent you?

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across CHEN's face.

LILY
(shouting)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

CHEN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

CHEN
(beat)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.
