INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

MARIA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MARIA
(shouting)
I can't do this anymore.

MARIA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

MARIA
(beat)
Who sent you?

MARIA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MARIA
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

Rain hammers the glass. MARIA stares out, jaw tight.

MARIA
(whispering)
I can't do this anymore.

Papers scatter across the desk as MARIA searches frantically.

MARIA
(shouting)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.


INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

OMAR slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

MARIA
(shouting)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

MARIA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MARIA
(shouting)
That's not what I meant and you know it.
