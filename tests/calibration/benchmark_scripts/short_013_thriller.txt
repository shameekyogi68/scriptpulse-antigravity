EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

CHEN enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

CHEN
(angry)
We need to talk about what happened.

The room is silent. CHEN paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

CHEN
(whispering)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

CHEN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

CHEN
(laughing)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?
