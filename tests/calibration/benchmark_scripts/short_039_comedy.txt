EXT. FOREST - DUSK

CHEN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

CHEN
(quietly)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

CHEN enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

CHEN
(sighs)
One chance. That's all we get.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

CHEN slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

SARAH
(beat)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across CHEN's face.

SARAH
(shouting)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SARAH freezes, listening.

SARAH
(sighs)
One chance. That's all we get.

CHEN slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

CHEN
(beat)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. SARAH rubs tired eyes.

CHEN
It's over. Accept it.


INT. COURTROOM - DAY

CHEN enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

CHEN
(sighs)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

Rain hammers the glass. CHEN stares out, jaw tight.

SARAH
(angry)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.
