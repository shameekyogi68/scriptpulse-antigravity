INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

JOHN enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

JOHN
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

A siren wails outside. SOFIA pulls the curtain aside carefully.

SOFIA
(quietly)
I can't do this anymore.

The clock ticks. SOFIA watches the second hand crawl.

JOHN
(whispering)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. SOFIA rubs tired eyes.

SOFIA
(angry)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Papers scatter across the desk as CHEN searches frantically.

JOHN
(whispering)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

Footsteps echo in the corridor. JOHN freezes, listening.

JOHN
(beat)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

A siren wails outside. JOHN pulls the curtain aside carefully.

PRIYA
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.
