INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

MICHAEL sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

SOFIA
(laughing)
This changes everything.

The room is silent. MICHAEL paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

MICHAEL
(quietly)
This changes everything.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SOFIA freezes, listening.

SOFIA
(whispering)
It's over. Accept it.

A siren wails outside. SOFIA pulls the curtain aside carefully.

SOFIA
(whispering)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?


INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Rain hammers the glass. KATE stares out, jaw tight.

LILY
(whispering)
I can't do this anymore.

A siren wails outside. KATE pulls the curtain aside carefully.

KATE
(quietly)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. LILY freezes, listening.

LILY
(sighs)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

LILY enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

LILY
(laughing)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. KATE rubs tired eyes.

MICHAEL
(angry)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

Rain hammers the glass. KATE stares out, jaw tight.

KATE
(angry)
Who sent you?

The room is silent. KATE paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

KATE
(sighs)
We need to talk about what happened.
