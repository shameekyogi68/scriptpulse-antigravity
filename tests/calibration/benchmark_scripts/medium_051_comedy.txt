EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

LILY picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MARIA
(quietly)
I can't do this anymore.

MARIA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

LILY
(angry)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

LILY enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

LILY
(sighs)
This changes everything.

MARIA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

LILY
(whispering)
It's over. Accept it.

A siren wails outside. LILY pulls the curtain aside carefully.

MARIA
(shouting)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?


INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Rain hammers the glass. MARIA stares out, jaw tight.

MARIA
(angry)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

MARIA sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

MARIA
(whispering)
We need to talk about what happened.


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The room is silent. SARAH paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

SARAH
(quietly)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SARAH freezes, listening.

SARAH
(whispering)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SARAH freezes, listening.

SARAH
This changes everything.

SARAH slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

SARAH
(beat)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

Papers scatter across the desk as SARAH searches frantically.

SARAH
(quietly)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.


EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

MARIA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MARIA
(whispering)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. MARIA freezes, listening.

MARIA
(laughing)
That's not what I meant and you know it.
