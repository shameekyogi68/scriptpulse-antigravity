EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

LILY sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

JAMES
(laughing)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. JAMES rubs tired eyes.

JAMES
(quietly)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?


INT. COURTROOM - DAY

JAMES picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

JAMES
(beat)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

JAMES picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

JAMES
(sighs)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

The room is silent. JAMES paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

JAMES
We need to talk about what happened.

Papers scatter across the desk as JAMES searches frantically.

JAMES
(sighs)
One chance. That's all we get.
