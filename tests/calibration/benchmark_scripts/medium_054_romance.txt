INT. LIBRARY - DAY

RAVI enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

RAVI
(beat)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

The room is silent. RAVI paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

RAVI
(quietly)
This changes everything.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. RAVI rubs tired eyes.

RAVI
(beat)
I can't do this anymore.

Rain hammers the glass. RAVI stares out, jaw tight.

RAVI
(beat)
The results came back. It's confirmed.


INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across JOHN's face.

RAVI
(laughing)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

A siren wails outside. RAVI pulls the curtain aside carefully.

JOHN
Who sent you?

RAVI sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

RAVI
(quietly)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

JOHN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

JOHN
(whispering)
It's over. Accept it.

Rain hammers the glass. JOHN stares out, jaw tight.

JOHN
(sighs)
That's not what I meant and you know it.


EXT. FOREST - DUSK

JOHN enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

JOHN
(shouting)
I can't do this anymore.

JOHN
(quietly)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across JOHN's face.

RAVI
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

JOHN
(angry)
It's over. Accept it.

RAVI enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

JOHN
(laughing)
That's not what I meant and you know it.


EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

RAVI sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

RAVI
(laughing)
One chance. That's all we get.

Rain hammers the glass. RAVI stares out, jaw tight.

RAVI
(quietly)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.


INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

A siren wails outside. RAVI pulls the curtain aside carefully.

RAVI
(quietly)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

The clock ticks. RAVI watches the second hand crawl.

RAVI
(beat)
It's over. Accept it.

RAVI slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

RAVI
(quietly)
It's over. Accept it.
