EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

Papers scatter across the desk as CHEN searches frantically.

CHEN
(whispering)
We need to talk about what happened.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across KATE's face.

CHEN
(whispering)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

KATE picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

KATE
(beat)
That's not what I meant and you know it.


INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

KATE picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

KATE
(shouting)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

KATE slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

KATE
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

KATE picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

KATE
I can't do this anymore.

A siren wails outside. KATE pulls the curtain aside carefully.

KATE
(angry)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.


INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Rain hammers the glass. CHEN stares out, jaw tight.

CHEN
(shouting)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

MARIA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

CHEN
(quietly)
It's over. Accept it.

MARIA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

CHEN
(sighs)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

The clock ticks. CHEN watches the second hand crawl.

CHEN
(quietly)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. MARIA rubs tired eyes.

CHEN
(quietly)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.


EXT. BEACH - DAWN

CHEN slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

CHEN
(angry)
We need to talk about what happened.

Papers scatter across the desk as CHEN searches frantically.

CHEN
(beat)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

CHEN sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

CHEN
It's over. Accept it.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across CHEN's face.

CHEN
(shouting)
Who sent you?

CHEN sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

CHEN
(beat)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.
