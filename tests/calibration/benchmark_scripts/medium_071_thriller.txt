EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The clock ticks. RAVI watches the second hand crawl.

JAMES
(angry)
I can't do this anymore.

The room is silent. JAMES paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

JAMES
(quietly)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

The room is silent. JAMES paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

RAVI
(laughing)
This changes everything.


INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

JAMES enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

RAVI
(laughing)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across KATE's face.

KATE
(whispering)
One chance. That's all we get.

RAVI enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

KATE
(laughing)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

JAMES enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

RAVI
(laughing)
This changes everything.

KATE enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

JAMES
(shouting)
I can't do this anymore.


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

KATE slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

JAMES
(laughing)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

JAMES enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

KATE
(shouting)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

A siren wails outside. JAMES pulls the curtain aside carefully.

JAMES
(whispering)
I can't do this anymore.


INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

Rain hammers the glass. RAVI stares out, jaw tight.

KATE
(sighs)
Who sent you?

RAVI picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

KATE
(quietly)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. RAVI freezes, listening.

KATE
(angry)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.


INT. BAR - NIGHT

Footsteps echo in the corridor. RAVI freezes, listening.

RAVI
(shouting)
It's over. Accept it.

The room is silent. RAVI paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

RAVI
(laughing)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

RAVI enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

RAVI
(beat)
I can't do this anymore.
