EXT. ROOFTOP - SUNSET

Rain hammers the glass. ALEX stares out, jaw tight.

ALEX
(whispering)
Who sent you?

A siren wails outside. SOFIA pulls the curtain aside carefully.

SOFIA
(sighs)
I can't do this anymore.

Papers scatter across the desk as ALEX searches frantically.

SOFIA
This changes everything.


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

SOFIA sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

ALEX
(shouting)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

SOFIA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

ALEX
(beat)
The results came back. It's confirmed.


EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across SOFIA's face.

This changes everything.

The room is silent. SOFIA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

(sighs)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

Papers scatter across the desk as SOFIA searches frantically.

SOFIA
(sighs)
We don't have much time. Where is it?


EXT. BEACH - DAWN

ALEX picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

I can't do this anymore.

The clock ticks. ALEX watches the second hand crawl.

SOFIA
(quietly)
One chance. That's all we get.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. ALEX freezes, listening.

(quietly)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.
