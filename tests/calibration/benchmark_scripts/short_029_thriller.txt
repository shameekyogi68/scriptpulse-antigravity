INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. PRIYA rubs tired eyes.

PRIYA
(laughing)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

PRIYA sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

ELENA
(beat)
It's over. Accept it.

ELENA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

PRIYA
(quietly)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

The room is silent. ELENA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

PRIYA
(quietly)
This changes everything.
