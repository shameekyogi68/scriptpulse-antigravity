EXT. FOREST - DUSK

CHEN sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

ELENA
(sighs)
Who sent you?

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. CHEN rubs tired eyes.

ELENA
(beat)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

A siren wails outside. ELENA pulls the curtain aside carefully.

CHEN
(beat)
One chance. That's all we get.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across ELENA's face.

CHEN
(angry)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.


INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Footsteps echo in the corridor. JAMES freezes, listening.

JAMES
(beat)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

The clock ticks. JAMES watches the second hand crawl.

JAMES
(sighs)
We don't have much time. Where is it?


INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Papers scatter across the desk as PRIYA searches frantically.

CHEN
(angry)
I can't do this anymore.

PRIYA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

CHEN
It's over. Accept it.

PRIYA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

CHEN
(sighs)
Who sent you?

The room is silent. PRIYA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

PRIYA
(angry)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

PRIYA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

PRIYA
(angry)
This changes everything.
