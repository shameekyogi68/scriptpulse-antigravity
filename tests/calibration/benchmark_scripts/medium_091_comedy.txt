INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Papers scatter across the desk as JOHN searches frantically.

JOHN
(shouting)
One chance. That's all we get.

Rain hammers the glass. MICHAEL stares out, jaw tight.

MICHAEL
(laughing)
I can't do this anymore.

A siren wails outside. JOHN pulls the curtain aside carefully.

MICHAEL
(shouting)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.


INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

JOHN slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

JOHN
(whispering)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

Papers scatter across the desk as MICHAEL searches frantically.

JOHN
(whispering)
One chance. That's all we get.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

Papers scatter across the desk as PRIYA searches frantically.

PRIYA
(sighs)
It's over. Accept it.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. JOHN freezes, listening.

JOHN
(sighs)
It's over. Accept it.


INT. BAR - NIGHT

Footsteps echo in the corridor. JOHN freezes, listening.

MICHAEL
(sighs)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

JOHN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

JOHN
That's not what I meant and you know it.

PRIYA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MICHAEL
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. JOHN rubs tired eyes.

PRIYA
(laughing)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

PRIYA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

PRIYA
The results came back. It's confirmed.
