EXT. ROOFTOP - SUNSET

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. JAMES rubs tired eyes.

ELENA
(beat)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

Rain hammers the glass. ELENA stares out, jaw tight.

JAMES
(whispering)
Who sent you?

A siren wails outside. JAMES pulls the curtain aside carefully.

ELENA
(laughing)
This changes everything.
