EXT. ROOFTOP - SUNSET

A siren wails outside. KATE pulls the curtain aside carefully.

KATE
(laughing)
It's over. Accept it.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across KATE's face.

KATE
This changes everything.

Rain hammers the glass. KATE stares out, jaw tight.

KATE
(angry)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.


INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

A siren wails outside. KATE pulls the curtain aside carefully.

KATE
(shouting)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across KATE's face.

KATE
(sighs)
We need to talk about what happened.

KATE picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

KATE
(whispering)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?


EXT. FOREST - DUSK

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across KATE's face.

KATE
(shouting)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

KATE slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

KATE
(whispering)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

Papers scatter across the desk as KATE searches frantically.

KATE
(laughing)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.


INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

A siren wails outside. KATE pulls the curtain aside carefully.

KATE
(sighs)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. KATE rubs tired eyes.

KATE
(shouting)
Who sent you?

KATE picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

KATE
(whispering)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.


EXT. BEACH - DAWN

A siren wails outside. OMAR pulls the curtain aside carefully.

OMAR
(sighs)
This changes everything.

Papers scatter across the desk as KATE searches frantically.

OMAR
(quietly)
We need to talk about what happened.


INT. COURTROOM - DAY

LILY sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

LILY
(quietly)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across LILY's face.

LILY
(quietly)
It's over. Accept it.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across LILY's face.

LILY
(sighs)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.
