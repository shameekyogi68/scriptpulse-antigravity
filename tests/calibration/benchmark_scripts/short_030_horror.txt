INT. OFFICE - DAY

Rain hammers the glass. JAMES stares out, jaw tight.

KATE
(quietly)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

The clock ticks. KATE watches the second hand crawl.

JAMES
(angry)
It's over. Accept it.

A siren wails outside. ALEX pulls the curtain aside carefully.

ALEX
(quietly)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. KATE freezes, listening.

ALEX
(sighs)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

ALEX slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

ALEX
(whispering)
We need to talk about what happened.
