EXT. BEACH - DAWN

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. ELENA rubs tired eyes.

ELENA
(beat)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. ELENA rubs tired eyes.

ELENA
(angry)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.


INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

Footsteps echo in the corridor. CHEN freezes, listening.

CHEN
(whispering)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across CHEN's face.

CHEN
(shouting)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

Footsteps echo in the corridor. CHEN freezes, listening.

CHEN
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. CHEN rubs tired eyes.

CHEN
(whispering)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

The room is silent. CHEN paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

CHEN
(laughing)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.


INT. BAR - NIGHT

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across ELENA's face.

ELENA
(beat)
I can't do this anymore.

CHEN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

CHEN
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. ELENA freezes, listening.

CHEN
(laughing)
It's over. Accept it.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. CHEN rubs tired eyes.

CHEN
Look at me. Tell me the truth.
