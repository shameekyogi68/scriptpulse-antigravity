EXT. FOREST - DUSK

CHEN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

JOHN
(shouting)
I can't do this anymore.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. CHEN rubs tired eyes.

CHEN
(angry)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. JOHN rubs tired eyes.

JOHN
(quietly)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across CHEN's face.

CHEN
(shouting)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across JOHN's face.

JOHN
(quietly)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

CHEN sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

CHEN
(beat)
I can't do this anymore.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. JOHN freezes, listening.

JOHN
(shouting)
Who sent you?

JOHN sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

CHEN
(sighs)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. JOHN rubs tired eyes.

CHEN
That's not what I meant and you know it.


INT. LIBRARY - DAY

The room is silent. CHEN paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

CHEN
(beat)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. CHEN freezes, listening.

CHEN
(laughing)
Who sent you?

CHEN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

JOHN
(shouting)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

The clock ticks. CHEN watches the second hand crawl.

JOHN
(shouting)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?


INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Rain hammers the glass. CHEN stares out, jaw tight.

CHEN
(quietly)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

Rain hammers the glass. CHEN stares out, jaw tight.

CHEN
(angry)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.
