INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

MICHAEL picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MICHAEL
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across MICHAEL's face.

MICHAEL
(laughing)
This changes everything.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. MICHAEL rubs tired eyes.

MICHAEL
(quietly)
We need to talk about what happened.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across MICHAEL's face.

MICHAEL
(shouting)
It's over. Accept it.

A siren wails outside. MICHAEL pulls the curtain aside carefully.

MICHAEL
(sighs)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.


EXT. BEACH - DAWN

A siren wails outside. ALEX pulls the curtain aside carefully.

LILY
One chance. That's all we get.

ELENA sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

ALEX
(quietly)
It's over. Accept it.

Rain hammers the glass. ALEX stares out, jaw tight.

ALEX
(angry)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

Papers scatter across the desk as ALEX searches frantically.

LILY
I told you this would happen. You never listen.


EXT. ROOFTOP - SUNSET

The room is silent. ALEX paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

LILY
(shouting)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

A siren wails outside. LILY pulls the curtain aside carefully.

LILY
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

ALEX sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

LILY
(angry)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

LILY picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

LILY
(beat)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

The room is silent. LILY paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

LILY
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

Rain hammers the glass. LILY stares out, jaw tight.

LILY
(quietly)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.
