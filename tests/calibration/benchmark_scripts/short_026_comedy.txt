Rain hammers the glass. MICHAEL stares out, jaw tight.

MICHAEL
(laughing)
We need to talk about what happened.

Papers scatter across the desk as MICHAEL searches frantically.

MICHAEL
(laughing)
It's over. Accept it.

The clock ticks. MICHAEL watches the second hand crawl.

MICHAEL
(angry)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.


INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

JAMES sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

JAMES
(shouting)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across JAMES's face.

JAMES
(laughing)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

Papers scatter across the desk as JAMES searches frantically.

JAMES
(angry)
We need to talk about what happened.

ELENA sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

ELENA
(shouting)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.
