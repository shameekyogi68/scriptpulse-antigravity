JAMES slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

That's not what I meant and you know it.


INT. BAR - NIGHT

The room is silent. SOFIA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

You think this is easy? Try living my life.

A siren wails outside. JAMES pulls the curtain aside carefully.

PRIYA
(sighs)
One chance. That's all we get.

JAMES picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

PRIYA
(beat)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

JAMES sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

JAMES
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.
