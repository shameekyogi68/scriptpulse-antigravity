INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

The room is silent. SOFIA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

SOFIA
(shouting)
I can't do this anymore.

Rain hammers the glass. SOFIA stares out, jaw tight.

SOFIA
(beat)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The room is silent. SOFIA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

SOFIA
(sighs)
I can't do this anymore.

SOFIA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

MICHAEL
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. SOFIA rubs tired eyes.

SOFIA
(quietly)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SOFIA freezes, listening.

MICHAEL
(beat)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

MICHAEL sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

MICHAEL
(sighs)
It's over. Accept it.
