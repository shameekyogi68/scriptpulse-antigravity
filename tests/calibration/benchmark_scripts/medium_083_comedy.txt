EXT. BEACH - DAWN

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. DAVID rubs tired eyes.

DAVID
(quietly)
One chance. That's all we get.

DAVID slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

DAVID
(beat)
We need to talk about what happened.

A siren wails outside. OMAR pulls the curtain aside carefully.

OMAR
(angry)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

DAVID sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

DAVID
(angry)
Who sent you?

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across DAVID's face.

DAVID
(whispering)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

Rain hammers the glass. DAVID stares out, jaw tight.

DAVID
(quietly)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.


INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

The clock ticks. MARIA watches the second hand crawl.

SARAH
(angry)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. KATE rubs tired eyes.

SARAH
(sighs)
One chance. That's all we get.

MARIA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

KATE
That's not what I meant and you know it.

The clock ticks. MARIA watches the second hand crawl.

MARIA
(beat)
Who sent you?


EXT. FOREST - DUSK

A siren wails outside. DAVID pulls the curtain aside carefully.

(beat)
It's over. Accept it.

I can't do this anymore.

The room is silent. DAVID paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

DAVID
The results came back. It's confirmed.

DAVID sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

DAVID
(angry)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

(angry)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SARAH freezes, listening.
