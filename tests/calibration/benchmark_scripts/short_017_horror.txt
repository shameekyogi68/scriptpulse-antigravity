EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The room is silent. LILY paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

RAVI
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. RAVI rubs tired eyes.

RAVI
(sighs)
This changes everything.


INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

A siren wails outside. RAVI pulls the curtain aside carefully.

LILY
(shouting)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

LILY enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

RAVI
Who sent you?

The clock ticks. LILY watches the second hand crawl.

LILY
(angry)
We need to talk about what happened.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. MICHAEL freezes, listening.

LILY
(quietly)
It's over. Accept it.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. RAVI freezes, listening.

MICHAEL
(shouting)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.
