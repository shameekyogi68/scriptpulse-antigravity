INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Rain hammers the glass. CHEN stares out, jaw tight.

PRIYA
(laughing)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

PRIYA sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

PRIYA
(quietly)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

Rain hammers the glass. CHEN stares out, jaw tight.

PRIYA
(whispering)
Who sent you?

A siren wails outside. CHEN pulls the curtain aside carefully.

CHEN
(beat)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

CHEN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

CHEN
(quietly)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

Footsteps echo in the corridor. CHEN freezes, listening.

CHEN
(quietly)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across CHEN's face.

CHEN
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

CHEN enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

CHEN
(sighs)
We need to talk about what happened.

The room is silent. CHEN paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

CHEN
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. CHEN freezes, listening.

CHEN
(angry)
Who sent you?


EXT. ROOFTOP - SUNSET

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across PRIYA's face.

PRIYA
(quietly)
Who sent you?

PRIYA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

PRIYA
(sighs)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. PRIYA freezes, listening.

PRIYA
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. PRIYA freezes, listening.

PRIYA
(quietly)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

(shouting)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

CHEN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

PRIYA
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

CHEN slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

KATE
(shouting)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

A siren wails outside. KATE pulls the curtain aside carefully.

CHEN
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

KATE sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

CHEN
(whispering)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

Rain hammers the glass. KATE stares out, jaw tight.

KATE
(shouting)
This changes everything.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. KATE rubs tired eyes.

KATE
(sighs)
One chance. That's all we get.

A siren wails outside. KATE pulls the curtain aside carefully.

KATE
(shouting)
One chance. That's all we get.
