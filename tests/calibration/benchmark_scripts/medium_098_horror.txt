This changes everything.

The room is silent. SARAH paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

SARAH
(quietly)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

KATE picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

KATE
(shouting)
Who sent you?

Promise me you won't tell anyone.

I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.
