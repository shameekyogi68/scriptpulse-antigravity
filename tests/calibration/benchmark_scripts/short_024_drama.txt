INT. LIBRARY - DAY

KATE enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

KATE
(beat)
I can't do this anymore.

KATE slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

SARAH
(whispering)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

Rain hammers the glass. SARAH stares out, jaw tight.

SARAH
(sighs)
This changes everything.

A siren wails outside. KATE pulls the curtain aside carefully.

SARAH
(angry)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

The room is silent. KATE paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

SARAH
(beat)
We don't have much time. Where is it?


EXT. BEACH - DAWN

SARAH slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

SARAH
(quietly)
One chance. That's all we get.

The clock ticks. SARAH watches the second hand crawl.

SARAH
That's not what I meant and you know it.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. SARAH rubs tired eyes.

SARAH
(shouting)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. SARAH rubs tired eyes.

SARAH
(laughing)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SARAH freezes, listening.

SARAH
That's not what I meant and you know it.
