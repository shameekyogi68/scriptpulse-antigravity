INT. BAR - NIGHT

MICHAEL picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MICHAEL
(sighs)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across PRIYA's face.

MICHAEL
(quietly)
This changes everything.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. MICHAEL rubs tired eyes.

MICHAEL
(quietly)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

A siren wails outside. PRIYA pulls the curtain aside carefully.

MICHAEL
(whispering)
This changes everything.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across PRIYA's face.

MICHAEL
(shouting)
The results came back. It's confirmed.


EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

A siren wails outside. PRIYA pulls the curtain aside carefully.

PRIYA
(shouting)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

Rain hammers the glass. PRIYA stares out, jaw tight.

PRIYA
(shouting)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

PRIYA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

PRIYA
(shouting)
The results came back. It's confirmed.


INT. BAR - NIGHT

Papers scatter across the desk as MICHAEL searches frantically.

PRIYA
(shouting)
It's over. Accept it.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. PRIYA rubs tired eyes.

MICHAEL
(sighs)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

The clock ticks. MICHAEL watches the second hand crawl.

MICHAEL
(sighs)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

A siren wails outside. PRIYA pulls the curtain aside carefully.

MICHAEL
(laughing)
We need to talk about what happened.
