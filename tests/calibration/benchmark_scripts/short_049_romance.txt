INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

Rain hammers the glass. SOFIA stares out, jaw tight.

MARIA
(sighs)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

The room is silent. MARIA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

MARIA
(whispering)
One chance. That's all we get.

The clock ticks. MARIA watches the second hand crawl.

MARIA
(angry)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.


INT. LIBRARY - DAY

MARIA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MARIA
(beat)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SOFIA freezes, listening.

MARIA
(whispering)
Who sent you?
