EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The room is silent. SOFIA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

JAMES
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

SOFIA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

SARAH
(beat)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across SARAH's face.

JAMES
(sighs)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

SOFIA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

SOFIA
(angry)
This changes everything.

The room is silent. SOFIA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

(shouting)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. SOFIA rubs tired eyes.

SOFIA
(beat)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

The room is silent. SOFIA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

One chance. That's all we get.

Papers scatter across the desk as SOFIA searches frantically.

SOFIA
(quietly)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

(sighs)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

(whispering)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SOFIA freezes, listening.

SOFIA
(sighs)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

SOFIA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

SOFIA
(angry)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

A siren wails outside. JAMES pulls the curtain aside carefully.

We don't have much time. Where is it?
