EXT. FOREST - DUSK

Papers scatter across the desk as JAMES searches frantically.

JAMES
(beat)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

The room is silent. JAMES paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

JAMES
(angry)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. JAMES freezes, listening.

JAMES
(shouting)
Who sent you?


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Papers scatter across the desk as SARAH searches frantically.

SARAH
(beat)
Who sent you?

The clock ticks. JAMES watches the second hand crawl.

JAMES
(angry)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SARAH freezes, listening.

JAMES
(whispering)
We need to talk about what happened.

SARAH sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

JAMES
(shouting)
I can't do this anymore.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

The clock ticks. JAMES watches the second hand crawl.

SARAH
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

The room is silent. JAMES paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

(quietly)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

JOHN enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

JOHN
(laughing)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

One chance. That's all we get.


EXT. BEACH - DAWN

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. ALEX rubs tired eyes.

ALEX
(quietly)
This changes everything.

JAMES slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

ALEX
(beat)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

The clock ticks. ALEX watches the second hand crawl.

ALEX
(laughing)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

ALEX picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

JOHN
(angry)
We need to talk about what happened.

The clock ticks. JOHN watches the second hand crawl.

Rain hammers the glass. JOHN stares out, jaw tight.

(laughing)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

A siren wails outside. ALEX pulls the curtain aside carefully.

(whispering)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.
