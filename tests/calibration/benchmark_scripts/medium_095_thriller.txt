INT. BAR - NIGHT

Rain hammers the glass. RAVI stares out, jaw tight.

RAVI
(quietly)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

RAVI enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

RAVI
(shouting)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

RAVI picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

RAVI
(quietly)
That's not what I meant and you know it.


EXT. BEACH - DAWN

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across SARAH's face.

KATE
(quietly)
Who sent you?

The room is silent. SARAH paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

SARAH
(laughing)
Who sent you?


EXT. FOREST - DUSK

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across KATE's face.

KATE
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

KATE slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

KATE
(whispering)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

Papers scatter across the desk as KATE searches frantically.

KATE
(angry)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

KATE enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

KATE
(shouting)
This changes everything.


INT. BAR - NIGHT

Papers scatter across the desk as SARAH searches frantically.

KATE
(quietly)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. KATE freezes, listening.

KATE
(beat)
This changes everything.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

RAVI enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

RAVI
(quietly)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

Papers scatter across the desk as RAVI searches frantically.

RAVI
(sighs)
Who sent you?


EXT. ROOFTOP - SUNSET

Footsteps echo in the corridor. RAVI freezes, listening.

RAVI
(angry)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

Rain hammers the glass. KATE stares out, jaw tight.

RAVI
(shouting)
One chance. That's all we get.


EXT. BEACH - DAWN

RAVI picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

SARAH
(beat)
Who sent you?

Papers scatter across the desk as SARAH searches frantically.

RAVI
(beat)
We need to talk about what happened.

Rain hammers the glass. RAVI stares out, jaw tight.

RAVI
(quietly)
Who sent you?

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across RAVI's face.

SARAH
(quietly)
This changes everything.
