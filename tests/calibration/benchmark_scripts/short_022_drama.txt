INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

KATE sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

CHEN
(laughing)
It's over. Accept it.

MICHAEL enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

KATE
(beat)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

Papers scatter across the desk as CHEN searches frantically.

KATE
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

MICHAEL slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

KATE
(laughing)
I can't do this anymore.


INT. BAR - NIGHT

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across CHEN's face.

CHEN
(sighs)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. CHEN rubs tired eyes.

CHEN
(sighs)
I can't do this anymore.

CHEN sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

CHEN
(shouting)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across CHEN's face.

CHEN
(sighs)
That's not what I meant and you know it.
