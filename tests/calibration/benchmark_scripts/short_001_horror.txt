INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

ELENA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

ELENA
(shouting)
One chance. That's all we get.

Rain hammers the glass. PRIYA stares out, jaw tight.

ELENA
(beat)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

PRIYA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

ELENA
(quietly)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

PRIYA sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

ELENA
(beat)
This changes everything.

Papers scatter across the desk as PRIYA searches frantically.

ELENA
(quietly)
We need to talk about what happened.

ELENA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

PRIYA
(angry)
This changes everything.

ELENA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

PRIYA
(whispering)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

The room is silent. ELENA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

PRIYA
(whispering)
This changes everything.
