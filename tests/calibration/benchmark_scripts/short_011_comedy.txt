INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Footsteps echo in the corridor. CHEN freezes, listening.

ELENA
(whispering)
It's over. Accept it.

The room is silent. CHEN paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

ELENA
(angry)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. CHEN rubs tired eyes.

ELENA
(sighs)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.
