INT. BAR - NIGHT

Footsteps echo in the corridor. ALEX freezes, listening.

ALEX
(laughing)
This changes everything.

JAMES slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

ALEX
(beat)
That's not what I meant and you know it.


EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

CHEN sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

CHEN
(laughing)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

The clock ticks. CHEN watches the second hand crawl.

CHEN
(sighs)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

The clock ticks. ALEX watches the second hand crawl.

CHEN
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

CHEN slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

CHEN
(angry)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.


INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. ALEX rubs tired eyes.

SOFIA
(angry)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

SOFIA sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

ALEX
(quietly)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

Papers scatter across the desk as KATE searches frantically.

ALEX
(whispering)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

The room is silent. KATE paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

SOFIA
Look at me. Tell me the truth.


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

A siren wails outside. SOFIA pulls the curtain aside carefully.

SOFIA
I can't do this anymore.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SOFIA freezes, listening.

ALEX
(shouting)
One chance. That's all we get.
