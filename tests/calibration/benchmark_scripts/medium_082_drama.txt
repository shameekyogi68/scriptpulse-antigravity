EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

JAMES enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

JAMES
(sighs)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

The clock ticks. JAMES watches the second hand crawl.

JAMES
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

LILY sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

JAMES
(laughing)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

A siren wails outside. JAMES pulls the curtain aside carefully.

JAMES
(angry)
This changes everything.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. JAMES rubs tired eyes.

RAVI
(shouting)
It's over. Accept it.

Papers scatter across the desk as RAVI searches frantically.

RAVI
(laughing)
We need to talk about what happened.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across JAMES's face.

LILY
(whispering)
That's not what I meant and you know it.


INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Rain hammers the glass. RAVI stares out, jaw tight.

RAVI
(laughing)
I can't do this anymore.

RAVI enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

RAVI
Who sent you?


INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

Papers scatter across the desk as DAVID searches frantically.

RAVI
(beat)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. LILY freezes, listening.

RAVI
That's not what I meant and you know it.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across LILY's face.

DAVID
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across LILY's face.

LILY
(laughing)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.


INT. COURTROOM - DAY

The clock ticks. LILY watches the second hand crawl.

DAVID
(laughing)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

Papers scatter across the desk as LILY searches frantically.

JAMES
(laughing)
One chance. That's all we get.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. DAVID freezes, listening.

DAVID
(whispering)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.
