INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

The clock ticks. KATE watches the second hand crawl.

KATE
(whispering)
I can't do this anymore.

A siren wails outside. OMAR pulls the curtain aside carefully.

KATE
(laughing)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

The room is silent. KATE paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

OMAR
That's not what I meant and you know it.


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Rain hammers the glass. CHEN stares out, jaw tight.

OMAR
(shouting)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

The clock ticks. OMAR watches the second hand crawl.

CHEN
(sighs)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. KATE rubs tired eyes.

KATE
(laughing)
One chance. That's all we get.

The room is silent. KATE paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

KATE
(shouting)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

The clock ticks. OMAR watches the second hand crawl.

OMAR
(angry)
We need to talk about what happened.
