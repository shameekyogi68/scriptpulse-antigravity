INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across MICHAEL's face.

MICHAEL
Who sent you?

SOFIA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

LILY
(angry)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

LILY slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

LILY
(angry)
This changes everything.

Rain hammers the glass. MICHAEL stares out, jaw tight.

MICHAEL
(laughing)
This changes everything.

A siren wails outside. LILY pulls the curtain aside carefully.

SOFIA
We need to talk about what happened.


INT. BAR - NIGHT

The clock ticks. SOFIA watches the second hand crawl.

SOFIA
(sighs)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

SOFIA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

SOFIA
(sighs)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

SOFIA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

SOFIA

How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

The clock ticks. SOFIA watches the second hand crawl.

SOFIA

We need to talk about what happened.
