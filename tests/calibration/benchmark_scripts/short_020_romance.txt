INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The clock ticks. PRIYA watches the second hand crawl.

SARAH
(shouting)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

SARAH picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

PRIYA
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SARAH freezes, listening.

SARAH
The results came back. It's confirmed.


INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

Footsteps echo in the corridor. PRIYA freezes, listening.

PRIYA
(quietly)
Who sent you?

Papers scatter across the desk as PRIYA searches frantically.

PRIYA
(beat)
We don't have much time. Where is it?


INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

The room is silent. SARAH paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

PRIYA
(quietly)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. PRIYA rubs tired eyes.

PRIYA
Who sent you?

SARAH sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

SARAH
(quietly)
The results came back. It's confirmed.
