INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Footsteps echo in the corridor. ALEX freezes, listening.

SARAH
(beat)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

ALEX slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

ALEX
(angry)
Who sent you?

The room is silent. ALEX paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

ALEX
That's not what I meant and you know it.

The room is silent. SARAH paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

ALEX
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

The clock ticks. ALEX watches the second hand crawl.

SARAH
I can't do this anymore.


INT. COURTROOM - DAY

SARAH picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

KATE
(angry)
Who sent you?

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. SARAH rubs tired eyes.

SARAH
(quietly)
It's over. Accept it.

Papers scatter across the desk as KATE searches frantically.

KATE
(laughing)
I can't do this anymore.

Rain hammers the glass. SARAH stares out, jaw tight.

KATE
(quietly)
That's not what I meant and you know it.
