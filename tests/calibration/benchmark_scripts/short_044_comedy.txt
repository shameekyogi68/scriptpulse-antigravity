INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Footsteps echo in the corridor. JAMES freezes, listening.

JAMES
(beat)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

JAMES picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

ALEX
(beat)
I can't do this anymore.


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

MARIA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

MARIA
(whispering)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

Footsteps echo in the corridor. DAVID freezes, listening.

DAVID
(sighs)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.
