MARIA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

A siren wails outside. MICHAEL pulls the curtain aside carefully.

MARIA
(sighs)
The results came back. It's confirmed.


INT. COURTROOM - DAY

MICHAEL picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

(whispering)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

ELENA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

MICHAEL
(shouting)
Who sent you?

ELENA
(whispering)
I can't do this anymore.

Rain hammers the glass. MICHAEL stares out, jaw tight.

ELENA
(angry)
Who sent you?
