INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

DAVID enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

DAVID
(sighs)
One chance. That's all we get.

The clock ticks. DAVID watches the second hand crawl.

DAVID
(whispering)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

MARIA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

DAVID
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

Rain hammers the glass. MARIA stares out, jaw tight.

MARIA
(angry)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

DAVID enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

DAVID
(laughing)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

DAVID slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

MARIA
This changes everything.

Papers scatter across the desk as MARIA searches frantically.

DAVID
(sighs)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

Footsteps echo in the corridor. MARIA freezes, listening.

MARIA
(angry)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

The clock ticks. DAVID watches the second hand crawl.

DAVID
(quietly)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.


INT. BAR - NIGHT

MARIA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

DAVID
(shouting)
It's over. Accept it.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. MARIA rubs tired eyes.

MARIA
(whispering)
We need to talk about what happened.

Papers scatter across the desk as DAVID searches frantically.

MARIA
(shouting)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across DAVID's face.

MARIA
(laughing)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

The room is silent. DAVID paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

MARIA
(sighs)
It's over. Accept it.
