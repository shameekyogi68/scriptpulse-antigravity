INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across DAVID's face.

DAVID
(sighs)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

A siren wails outside. DAVID pulls the curtain aside carefully.

DAVID
(shouting)
I can't do this anymore.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across DAVID's face.

DAVID
(whispering)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. SARAH rubs tired eyes.

SARAH
(whispering)
It's over. Accept it.

SARAH picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

SARAH
(quietly)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

Papers scatter across the desk as SARAH searches frantically.

SARAH
(shouting)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.
