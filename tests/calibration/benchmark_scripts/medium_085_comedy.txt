INT. BAR - NIGHT

Footsteps echo in the corridor. ELENA freezes, listening.

RAVI
(sighs)
Who sent you?

The room is silent. RAVI paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

MARIA
(quietly)
This changes everything.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across MARIA's face.

MARIA
(angry)
Who sent you?

A siren wails outside. RAVI pulls the curtain aside carefully.

MARIA
(shouting)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

MARIA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

MARIA
(laughing)
I can't do this anymore.

The room is silent. MARIA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

MARIA
(angry)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

Rain hammers the glass. MARIA stares out, jaw tight.

MARIA
(shouting)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

The room is silent. MARIA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

MARIA
(beat)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.


INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

The room is silent. JAMES paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

JAMES
(shouting)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

The room is silent. JAMES paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

JAMES
(laughing)
Who sent you?

A siren wails outside. JAMES pulls the curtain aside carefully.

JAMES
(whispering)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The room is silent. JAMES paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

JAMES
(quietly)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

JAMES picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

JAMES
(sighs)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. JAMES rubs tired eyes.

JAMES
(beat)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. JAMES freezes, listening.

JAMES
We don't have much time. Where is it?

The room is silent. JAMES paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

JAMES
(laughing)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.
