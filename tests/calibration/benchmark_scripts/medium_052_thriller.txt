EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

OMAR slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

OMAR
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. OMAR freezes, listening.

OMAR
(laughing)
I can't do this anymore.

OMAR enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

OMAR
(sighs)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

OMAR picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

OMAR
(laughing)
We need to talk about what happened.


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Rain hammers the glass. ELENA stares out, jaw tight.

LILY
(shouting)
Who sent you?

A siren wails outside. LILY pulls the curtain aside carefully.

ELENA
(beat)
Who sent you?

Papers scatter across the desk as ELENA searches frantically.

LILY
(sighs)
One chance. That's all we get.

(sighs)
One chance. That's all we get.

The clock ticks. LILY watches the second hand crawl.

LILY
(beat)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

LILY slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

LILY
(whispering)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

Rain hammers the glass. LILY stares out, jaw tight.

LILY
(shouting)
That's not what I meant and you know it.


INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Papers scatter across the desk as OMAR searches frantically.

The results came back. It's confirmed.

Look at me. Tell me the truth.

The room is silent. ELENA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

(sighs)
We don't have much time. Where is it?
