EXT. STREET - NIGHT

JOHN sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

JOHN
(shouting)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

JOHN enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

JOHN
(beat)
The results came back. It's confirmed.


EXT. BEACH - DAWN

Rain hammers the glass. PRIYA stares out, jaw tight.

PRIYA
(shouting)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

The clock ticks. PRIYA watches the second hand crawl.

OMAR
(whispering)
It's over. Accept it.

OMAR sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

PRIYA
(sighs)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

Rain hammers the glass. OMAR stares out, jaw tight.

OMAR
(beat)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. PRIYA freezes, listening.

PRIYA
(quietly)
We need to talk about what happened.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

Footsteps echo in the corridor. SARAH freezes, listening.

SARAH
(beat)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. SARAH rubs tired eyes.

PRIYA
(quietly)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

SARAH enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

SARAH
(beat)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

Papers scatter across the desk as PRIYA searches frantically.

PRIYA
(laughing)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

A siren wails outside. SARAH pulls the curtain aside carefully.

PRIYA
(beat)
That's not what I meant and you know it.
