INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

MARIA enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

MICHAEL
(sighs)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across MARIA's face.

MICHAEL
(shouting)
It's over. Accept it.

MARIA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MICHAEL
(shouting)
I can't do this anymore.

MARIA picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MICHAEL
(whispering)
We don't have much time. Where is it?


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The room is silent. OMAR paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

MICHAEL
It's over. Accept it.

OMAR slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

OMAR
(shouting)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

Papers scatter across the desk as MICHAEL searches frantically.

MICHAEL
(quietly)
One chance. That's all we get.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across OMAR's face.

MICHAEL
(sighs)
This changes everything.

One chance. That's all we get.

(angry)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across LILY's face.

(whispering)
It's over. Accept it.

A siren wails outside. LILY pulls the curtain aside carefully.

You think this is easy? Try living my life.

The room is silent. LILY paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

LILY
(shouting)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

A siren wails outside. KATE pulls the curtain aside carefully.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. OMAR freezes, listening.

Who sent you?

Rain hammers the glass. KATE stares out, jaw tight.

KATE
(shouting)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.
