INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across KATE's face.

MARIA
(whispering)
Who sent you?

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. KATE rubs tired eyes.

KATE
We need to talk about what happened.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. MARIA freezes, listening.

KATE
(laughing)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

Rain hammers the glass. KATE stares out, jaw tight.

KATE
(angry)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

Papers scatter across the desk as MARIA searches frantically.

KATE
(laughing)
We need to talk about what happened.


INT. LIBRARY - DAY

RAVI picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

PRIYA
(laughing)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

PRIYA slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

PRIYA
(laughing)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

The room is silent. RAVI paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

RAVI
(beat)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across RAVI's face.

PRIYA
(sighs)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. RAVI rubs tired eyes.

RAVI
(shouting)
We need to talk about what happened.

The clock ticks. RAVI watches the second hand crawl.

RAVI
(quietly)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

RAVI enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

RAVI
(beat)
This changes everything.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across RAVI's face.

RAVI
(angry)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. RAVI freezes, listening.

RAVI
(quietly)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

The room is silent. PRIYA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

PRIYA
(quietly)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

ELENA sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

PRIYA
(whispering)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. PRIYA rubs tired eyes.

PRIYA
We don't have much time. Where is it?

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. PRIYA rubs tired eyes.

PRIYA
(angry)
That's not what I meant and you know it.
