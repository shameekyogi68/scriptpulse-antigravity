EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. SOFIA rubs tired eyes.

LILY
(laughing)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. SOFIA rubs tired eyes.

SOFIA
(whispering)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. LILY rubs tired eyes.

SOFIA
(shouting)
We need to talk about what happened.
