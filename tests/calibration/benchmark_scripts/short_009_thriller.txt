INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

Papers scatter across the desk as CHEN searches frantically.

CHEN
(laughing)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.

CHEN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

CHEN
(laughing)
This changes everything.

CHEN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

CHEN
(laughing)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

A siren wails outside. CHEN pulls the curtain aside carefully.

CHEN
Who sent you?


INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Rain hammers the glass. MICHAEL stares out, jaw tight.

MICHAEL
The results came back. It's confirmed.

MICHAEL sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

MICHAEL
(quietly)
It's over. Accept it.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. MICHAEL rubs tired eyes.

MICHAEL
(laughing)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

Papers scatter across the desk as MICHAEL searches frantically.

MICHAEL
(whispering)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

MICHAEL picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MICHAEL
(sighs)
One chance. That's all we get.
