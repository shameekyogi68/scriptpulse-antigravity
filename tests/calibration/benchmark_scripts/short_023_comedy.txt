INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

JAMES sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

JAMES
(quietly)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

JAMES slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

KATE
(angry)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. JAMES freezes, listening.

KATE
(laughing)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

A siren wails outside. DAVID pulls the curtain aside carefully.

DAVID
(beat)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The clock ticks. DAVID watches the second hand crawl.

KATE
(shouting)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. DAVID rubs tired eyes.

DAVID
(angry)
Who sent you?

Footsteps echo in the corridor. KATE freezes, listening.

DAVID
This changes everything.

KATE slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

KATE
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

A siren wails outside. DAVID pulls the curtain aside carefully.

DAVID
(beat)
We don't have much time. Where is it?
