INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

OMAR picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MICHAEL
(angry)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across OMAR's face.

OMAR
(sighs)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. OMAR freezes, listening.

MICHAEL
(laughing)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

OMAR slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

MICHAEL
(laughing)
Who sent you?


INT. BAR - NIGHT

The clock ticks. MICHAEL watches the second hand crawl.

MICHAEL
(sighs)
I can't do this anymore.

MICHAEL picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MICHAEL
(sighs)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

The room is silent. MICHAEL paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

MICHAEL
This changes everything.
