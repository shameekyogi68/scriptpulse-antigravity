EXT. BEACH - DAWN

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. OMAR rubs tired eyes.

SOFIA
(shouting)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

A siren wails outside. OMAR pulls the curtain aside carefully.

PRIYA
I can't do this anymore.

Papers scatter across the desk as SOFIA searches frantically.

OMAR
(beat)
Look at me. Tell me the truth.


EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across SOFIA's face.

OMAR
(quietly)
This changes everything.

A siren wails outside. OMAR pulls the curtain aside carefully.

SOFIA
(quietly)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.


INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

OMAR picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

LILY
(shouting)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

LILY picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

OMAR
(whispering)
It's over. Accept it.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across LILY's face.

LILY
(angry)
We need to talk about what happened.

The clock ticks. LILY watches the second hand crawl.

OMAR
I told you this would happen. You never listen.
