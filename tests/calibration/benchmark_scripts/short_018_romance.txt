EXT. FOREST - DUSK

Footsteps echo in the corridor. JOHN freezes, listening.

JOHN
(sighs)
I told you this would happen. You never listen.

JOHN sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

JOHN
(whispering)
That's not what I meant and you know it.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across JOHN's face.

JOHN
(whispering)
This changes everything.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. JOHN freezes, listening.

JOHN
(beat)
I'm leaving. Don't try to stop me.


INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

RAVI slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

RAVI
(angry)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

Rain hammers the glass. DAVID stares out, jaw tight.

DAVID
(beat)
One chance. That's all we get.

A siren wails outside. RAVI pulls the curtain aside carefully.

DAVID
That's not what I meant and you know it.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. DAVID rubs tired eyes.

RAVI
(shouting)
We don't have much time. Where is it?

The clock ticks. DAVID watches the second hand crawl.

RAVI
(sighs)
That's not what I meant and you know it.


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The clock ticks. JOHN watches the second hand crawl.

JOHN
(beat)
This changes everything.

The candle flickers. Shadows dance across DAVID's face.

JOHN
(shouting)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

JOHN slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

DAVID
(beat)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

JOHN enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

JOHN
(whispering)
Who sent you?

DAVID picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

JOHN
(quietly)
One chance. That's all we get.
