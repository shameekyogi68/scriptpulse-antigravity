INT. LIBRARY - DAY

The clock ticks. MARIA watches the second hand crawl.

MARIA
Who sent you?

The room is silent. SOFIA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

MARIA
(whispering)
One chance. That's all we get.

MARIA sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

SOFIA
(whispering)
We don't have much time. Where is it?


INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

The room is silent. ELENA paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

ELENA
(whispering)
We need to talk about what happened.

A siren wails outside. ELENA pulls the curtain aside carefully.

ELENA
(laughing)
Who sent you?

The room is silent. KATE paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

ELENA
(quietly)
We don't have much time. Where is it?


INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

A siren wails outside. SOFIA pulls the curtain aside carefully.

SOFIA
(sighs)
This changes everything.

Rain hammers the glass. SOFIA stares out, jaw tight.

SOFIA
(laughing)
We need to talk about what happened.
