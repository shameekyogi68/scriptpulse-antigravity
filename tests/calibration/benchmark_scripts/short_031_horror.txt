INT. COURTROOM - DAY

CHEN sits alone, staring at the empty chair across the table.

CHEN
(sighs)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

ALEX slams the door, rattling the windows. Dust falls from the ceiling.

KATE
(whispering)
We need to talk about what happened.

KATE enters slowly, scanning the room for threats.

CHEN
(whispering)
This changes everything.

Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. KATE rubs tired eyes.

KATE
(sighs)
One chance. That's all we get.


EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

CHEN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MICHAEL
(whispering)
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

CHEN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

CHEN
(laughing)
It's over. Accept it.


EXT. BEACH - DAWN

Papers scatter across the desk as MICHAEL searches frantically.

MICHAEL
It's over. Accept it.

The room is silent. MICHAEL paces back and forth, hands behind their back.

MICHAEL
(sighs)
One chance. That's all we get.

Papers scatter across the desk as MICHAEL searches frantically.

MICHAEL
(quietly)
This changes everything.

MICHAEL picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

MICHAEL
(quietly)
How long have you known? Days? Weeks?

Papers scatter across the desk as MICHAEL searches frantically.

MICHAEL
(angry)
That's not what I meant and you know it.
