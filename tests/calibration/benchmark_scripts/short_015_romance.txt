INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Footsteps echo in the corridor. DAVID freezes, listening.

JOHN
(beat)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.

The clock ticks. JOHN watches the second hand crawl.

DAVID
(laughing)
The results came back. It's confirmed.

JOHN picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

DAVID
(quietly)
You think this is easy? Try living my life.


EXT. FOREST - DUSK

DAVID picks up the phone, dials, hangs up. Dials again.

JOHN
(beat)
One chance. That's all we get.

Footsteps echo in the corridor. JOHN freezes, listening.

JOHN
(whispering)
I can't do this anymore.
