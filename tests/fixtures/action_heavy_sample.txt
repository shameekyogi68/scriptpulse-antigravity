EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

Explosions rock the landscape. Smoke billows from every direction.

Soldiers run across the field, ducking behind cover. Bullets whiz overhead.

A tank rolls forward, crushing debris beneath its treads. The turret swivels left and right, scanning for targets.

More explosions. The ground shakes.

Three soldiers sprint toward a bunker. One stumbles. The others help him up. They keep running.

A helicopter swoops low over the battlefield, its rotors creating a deafening roar. It fires rockets into enemy positions.

Fire spreads across the field. Buildings collapse in the distance.

The soldiers reach the bunker. They dive inside just as another explosion hits nearby.

Inside, they catch their breath. Dust falls from the ceiling. The walls shake with each impact.

One soldier checks his weapon. Another looks out through a narrow slit in the wall. The third tends to a minor wound.

Outside, the battle continues. The noise is relentless.
