INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The morning sun streams through large windows. A handful of CUSTOMERS sit at small tables.

SARAH, mid-30s, enters hesitantly. She scans the room.

SARAH
(to herself)
Where is he?

She approaches the counter where BARISTA, 20s, prepares drinks.

SARAH
Excuse me. Have you seen a tall man, gray jacket?

BARISTA
Not today, sorry.

Sarah sighs and moves to a corner table. She sits, pulling out her phone.

A TEXT MESSAGE appears: "Running late. 10 minutes."

Sarah relaxes slightly.

JOHN, 40s, gray jacket, rushes through the door.

JOHN
Sarah! Sorry I'm late.

SARAH
(standing)
It's fine. Let's talk.

They sit across from each other. An uncomfortable silence.

JOHN
About yesterday—

SARAH
Not here. Too public.

John nods.

FADE TO:

INT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Sarah and John walk to their cars.

JOHN
I didn't mean to...

SARAH
I know.

A beat.

SARAH (CONT'D)
We'll figure it out.

They exchange a brief look, then part ways.

FADE OUT.
