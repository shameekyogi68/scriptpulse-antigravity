INT. CAFE - DAY

ALICE
So what happened then?

BOB
I told her everything.

ALICE
Everything? Really?

BOB
Well, almost everything. The important parts.

ALICE
What did she say?

BOB
She laughed. Can you believe it? She actually laughed.

ALICE
That's good, right?

BOB
I don't know. Maybe. Probably. I think so.

ALICE
You think so?

BOB
I mean, yes. Definitely yes.

ALICE
Bob, you're overthinking this.

BOB
I know. I always do.

ALICE
So what's next?

BOB
I don't know. What do you think?

ALICE
You should call her.

BOB
Right now?

ALICE
Why not?

BOB
Because... I don't know. Maybe I should wait.

ALICE
Wait for what?

BOB
Good question.
