Abstract—This paper presents ScriptPulse vNext.4, a computational framework for modeling the temporal and attentional dynamics of screenplays without recourse to quality evaluation or semantic interpretation. Traditional automated script analysis often relies on probabilistic models that infer narrative quality or predict commercial success, inadvertently subjecting creative work to opaque biases and normative judgments. In contrast, ScriptPulse employs a deterministic, multi-agent pipeline to map structural features, tracking variables such as scene density, pacing, and cognitive load through explicit, rule-governed accumulation functions. The system integrates a novel “Intent Immunity” mechanism, ensuring that writer-declared artistic goals override algorithmic detection, thereby preserving authorial authority. Furthermore, an Audience-Experience Mediation layer translates quantitative signal patterns into non-prescriptive, interrogative reflections, mirroring the cognitive state of a first-time viewer rather than an expert critic. By restricting analysis to observable structural phenomena and enforcing strict ethical boundaries against evaluative language, this framework offers a transparency-focused alternative to black-box creative AI, facilitating writer reflection while preventing algorithmic overreach.
