I. INTRODUCTION

The rapid integration of computational tools into creative domains has fundamentally altered the landscape of narrative production. In screenwriting especially, automated analysis systems are increasingly deployed to evaluate commercial viability, predict audience engagement, and prescribe structural optimizations. While these systems offer efficiency, they frequently rely on probabilistic machine learning models trained on historical corpora of "successful" works. This reliance introduces significant ethical and creative risks: the codification of survivorship bias, the enforcement of normative structural templates, and the erosion of authorial agency through opaque, score-based feedback Loops. By framing creative quality as a metric to be optimized, such systems risk reducing the complex, subjective experience of storytelling to a set of statistical approximations.

A critical gap therefore exists for computational frameworks that support the creative process without attempting to evaluate or direct it. Writers require tools that can reflect the observable dynamics of their work—pacing, density, and attentional load—without imposing external judgments or "corrective" suggestions. Such a system must be deterministic rather than probabilistic, ensuring that outputs are traceable to specific textual evidence rather than latent vector associations. Furthermore, it must explicitly privilege writer intent over algorithmic detection, preventing the system from flagging deliberate artistic choices as errors.

This paper introduces ScriptPulse vNext.4, a computational framework designed to model the first-pass cognitive experience of a screenplay audience through strictly non-evaluative means. Unlike predictive systems, ScriptPulse does not output quality scores, success probabilities, or optimization advice. Instead, it employs a deterministic, rule-based pipeline to map structural and temporal features, accumulating signals of attentional demand and recovery over time. The system is governed by a "Design-for-Silence" philosophy, where the absence of strong signal patterns results in non-feedback rather than hallucinated insights.

Our contribution is threefold: (1) A deterministic method for modeling screenplay temporal dynamics using explicit accumulation functions; (2) An "Intent Immunity" mechanism that allows writers to override algorithmic detection with declared artistic goals; and (3) An Audience-Experience Mediation layer that translates quantitative patterns into interrogative, experiential reflections. By enforcing strict boundaries against evaluative language and preserving the writer's absolute authority, ScriptPulse proposes a new paradigm for creative support tools: one of transparent reflection rather than opaque prescription.
