II. RELATED WORK

A. Computational Support for Creative Writing
The development of computational tools to support creative writing has evolved from basic spell-checking and grammar correction to advanced stylistic analysis and co-authorship systems. Early work focused on syntactic correctness and readability metrics, providing feedback on sentence structure and word usage. More recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled systems capable of generating plot suggestions, character dialogue, and entire narrative segments. In the domain of screenwriting specifically, commercial software often integrates formatting assistance with analytical features that assess scene length, character presence, and dialogue distribution. These tools generally aim to reduce the friction of production mechanics or provide generative assistance to overcome creative blocks.

B. Narrative Structure and Temporal Analysis
A parallel body of research focuses on the computational analysis of narrative structure. Approaches include sentiment arc extraction to model emotional trajectories, topic modeling to track thematic coherence, and graph theory to map character interactions. Significant attention has been given to identifying narrative boundaries and distinct plot stages, often using supervised learning trained on annotated corpora (e.g., Hollywood movies or classic literature). Research in this area typically seeks to quantify narrative dynamics, defining metrics for "tension," "surprise," or "engagement" based on textual features. These methods often imply a correlation between specific structural patterns and narrative quality or success.

C. Ethical Considerations in Evaluative AI
The deployment of evaluative AI in creative domains has drawn increasing scrutiny regarding the risks of algorithmic bias and the narrowing of creative expression. Critics argue that systems trained on past successes may enforce a "regression to the mean," discouraging experimental or non-standard forms. Furthermore, the presentation of algorithmic outputs—often as objective scores or "optimization" targets—can influence writer behavior through authority bias, leading to self-censorship or mechanical adherence to detected patterns. The opacity of deep learning models further complicates this dynamic, as writers often cannot trace specific feedback to concrete textual evidence, making it difficult to critically assess the validity of the system's "judgment."

D. Positioning of the Present Work
ScriptPulse vNext.4 occupies a distinct position within this landscape. Unlike generative tools, it does not produce text or suggestions. Unlike predictive analytical systems, it does not utilize trained models to infer quality, sentiment, or success probability. Instead, it operates as a deterministic, rule-based framework designed to reflect observable structural dynamics back to the writer. This approach prioritizes transparency and auditability over predictive power. By strictly defining its outputs as experiential reflections rather than normative evaluations, the system addresses the ethical concerns regarding algorithmic authority and the preservation of writer intent in computational creative support.
