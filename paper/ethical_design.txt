V. ETHICAL & BOUNDARY DESIGN

Ethical considerations in ScriptPulse are implemented not as external policies, but as structural invariants encoded directly into the system architecture. This "ethics-by-construction" approach ensures that core boundaries cannot be bypassed by user prompting or stochastic variance.

A. Non-Evaluative Design Guarantee
The system is rigidly constrained to produce only experiential reflections. It lacks the internal vocabulary or metric space to generate normative judgments. There is no "score" variable, no "good/bad" classifier, and no comparison against a "gold standard" corpus. This design guarantee ensures that the system cannot, even in failure modes, output a quality assessment or a ranking relative to other works. By removing the capacity for evaluation at the architectural level, the risk of unearned algorithmic authority is mitigated.

B. Writer Authority and Intent Immunity
ScriptPulse enforces a strict hierarchy of authority where writer-declared intent supersedes algorithmic detection. The "Intent Immunity" mechanism functions as an absolute gate: if a computed signal pattern aligns with a declared artistic goal (e.g., "intentionally exhausting"), the signal is suppressed. Crucially, the system is prohibited from inferring intent; it must be explicitly declared by the writer. This prevents the system from "hallucinating" justification for poor structure while ensuring it never "corrects" a deliberate stylistic choice.

C. Silence as a First-Class Outcome
Unlike generative systems biased toward output, ScriptPulse treats silence as a valid and often preferred state. If no structural pattern meets the strict persistence and confidence thresholds, the system returns no feedback. This "Design-for-Silence" philosophy explicitly counters the pressure to provide insight where none exists. Silence in this framework does not imply success or failure; it indicates only the absence of specific, localized tension anomalies, preventing the system from over-interpreting noise as signal.

D. Misuse Resistance by Construction
Resistance to misuse is hard-coded into the interface and mediation layers. The system structurally rejects inputs framed as requests for evaluation (e.g., "Is this good?") or prescription (e.g., "How do I fix this?"). Such inputs trigger deterministic refusal responses that redirect the user to non-evaluative framing. Furthermore, the decoupling of analysis from advice ensures that the system physically cannot offer "fix-it" suggestions, as it lacks the generative module required to propose alternatives.

E. Auditability and Accountability
The deterministic nature of the pipeline facilitates complete accountability. Because behaviors are rule-governed rather than learned, any specific output can be traced back through the accumulation functions to the precise textual features that triggered it. This transparency allows for rigorous independent audit and prevents the emergence of hidden biases common in "black box" neural models. Users and stakeholders can inspect the logic governing the system's reflections, ensuring alignment with stated ethical boundaries.
