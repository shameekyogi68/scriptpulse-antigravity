VIII. CONCLUSION

The growing prevalence of evaluative and generative AI in creative workflows introduces significant risks to authorial agency and the diversity of narrative expression. By framing creative quality as a metric for optimization, predictive models inadvertently enforce normative standards and obscure the subjective nature of storytelling. ScriptPulse vNext.4 offers a distinct alternative: a computational framework designed for deterministic reflection rather than probabilistic judgment.

Through a rigorous pipeline of structural parsing, temporal modeling, and rule-governed mediation, the system provides writers with verifiable insights into the cognitive dynamics of their work without imposing external validation metrics. The integration of "Intent Immunity" and a "Design-for-Silence" philosophy ensures that the system operates strictly within the boundaries of writer authority, prioritizing safety and transparency over algorithmic assertiveness.

This work demonstrates that computational support need not come at the cost of creative autonomy. by systematically decoupling analysis from evaluation, ScriptPulse establishes a paradigm for responsible creative technology—one that amplifies the writer's own vision through transparent mirroring, rather than reshaping it through opaque prescription. The result is a tool that remains technically rigorous while adhering to a fundamental ethical constraint: the preservation of the human writer as the sole arbiter of narrative meaning and quality.
