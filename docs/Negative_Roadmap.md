# ScriptPulse Negative Roadmap (Invariant Constitution)
## Features We Will NEVER Build

To preserve the utility, safety, and philosophy of ScriptPulse as a **descriptive support tool for writers**, the following features are strictly prohibited. These are not "planned for later" — they are permanently out of scope.

---

### 1. No Normative Scoring
*   **NEVER** generate a "Quality Score" (e.g., "7/10", "A-").
*   **NEVER** generate a "Marketability Index".
*   **NEVER** aggregate internal signals into a single "Success Metric".
*   **Rationale:** Art is subjective. Scores displace human judgment and incentivize "gaming the metric" rather than improving the story.

### 2. No Comparative Ranking
*   **NEVER** rank a set of scripts against each other.
*   **NEVER** filter or sort scripts by "Best Structural Fit".
*   **NEVER** compare a script to a "Golden Set" of hit movies.
*   **Rationale:** Every story has unique structural needs. Comparative ranking leads to homogenization.

### 3. No Generative "Fixes"
*   **NEVER** rewrite dialogue or action to "optimize" the signal.
*   **NEVER** suggest specific plot changes.
*   **Rationale:** The writer must remain the sole author. Generative fixes bypass the cognitive struggle required for good storytelling.

### 4. No Employment/Funding Decisions
*   **NEVER** allow the tool to be the *sole* arbiter of hiring, funding, or greenlight.
*   **Rationale:** Algorithmic gatekeeping is unethical in creative fields. ScriptPulse is a lens, not a judge.

### 5. No Semantic analysis of "Themes" or "Moral"
*   **NEVER** attempt to extract the "meaning" or "politics" of a script.
*   **Rationale:** AI cannot understand subtext or human condition. Misinterpretation risk is 100%.

### Commitment to Silence
If ScriptPulse detects no significant structural friction, it will remain **Silent**. It will never hallucinate a problem just to prove it is working. 

**Silence is a valid and protected signal.**
