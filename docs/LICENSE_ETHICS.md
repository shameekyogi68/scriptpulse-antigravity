> **Version:** 5.2
> **Doctrine:** First-Pass Experiential Modeling
> **Status:** FINAL

## 1. End-of-Life Integrity Clause (ELIC)

This software is licensed under the condition that its **philosophical constraints remain intact**.

### 1.1 Evaluative Prohibition
Any fork, modification, or deployment of this system that introduces **scoring, ranking, comparative grading, or "pass/fail" mechanics** explicitly forfeits the right to use the name **"ScriptPulse"** or any derived branding.

### 1.2 Refusal Logic Permanence
The `Governance & Policy Boundary Layer (GPBL)` and `Negative Roadmap` are considered **invariant kernels**. Removing or disabling refusal logic constitutes a violation of the system's core definition.

---

## 2. Narrative Neutrality Seal (NNS)

The ScriptPulse engine is architected to be **narratively neutral**.

### 2.1 Forbidden Representations
The system code and internal models strictly prohibited from representing or inferring:
* **Story Goals** (What the character wants)
* **Narrative Stakes** (What happens if they fail)
* **Emotional Valence** (Happy/Sad)
* **Dramatic Irony**
* **Thematic Resonance**

### 2.2 Operational Constraint
The system models **Attentional Load**, not **Story Quality**. Any attempt to bridge this gap is a fundamental misunderstanding of the tool's purpose.

---

## 3. Audience Memory Horizon Lock (AMHL)

ScriptPulse models a **first-pass reader** with strictly limited working memory.

* **No Long-Term Attribution:** The system does not "remember" setups from Act 1 when analyzing Act 3, unless they are structurally reinforced.
* **Moment-to-Moment:** Analysis is causal and local. This protects against the illusion of "deep reading."

---

## 4. Attribution Firewall (AAF)

Output language is strictly constrained to **experiential description**.
* **Allowed:** "This scene typically requires high focus."
* **Forbidden:** "You wrote a confusing scene." or "The writer failed to clarify."

---

**By using or deploying this system, you agree to these immutable constraints.**
