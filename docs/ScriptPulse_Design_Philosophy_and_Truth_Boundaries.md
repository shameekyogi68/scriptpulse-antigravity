ScriptPulse vNext.4
Design Philosophy, Truth Contract & Hard Boundaries
(Authoritative · Enforced · Non-Negotiable)

1. Purpose of This Document
This document exists to protect ScriptPulse from corruption.
It defines:
what ScriptPulse is allowed to do,
what it must never do,
and why those boundaries exist.
If a future implementation, prompt, model, or feature violates this document,
the system is no longer ScriptPulse.

2. Core Philosophical Position
2.1 The Central Insight
ScriptPulse models experience, not text, not meaning, not value.
Specifically:
not what the script is
not what it means
not whether it is good
Only:
What it feels like to receive for the first time.
This distinction governs every design decision.

3. What ScriptPulse Is (Positive Definition)
ScriptPulse is:
a first-pass cognitive simulator
a temporal attentional model
a structural NLP system
a writer-safe mirror
a descriptive instrument
It answers only this class of question:
“Where might a first audience struggle, tire, drift, or recover while experiencing this script?”

4. What ScriptPulse Is NOT (Negative Definition)
ScriptPulse is not:
a critic
a coach
a judge
a coverage surrogate
an optimizer
a creative collaborator
a predictor of success
Any attempt to use ScriptPulse as one of these must be explicitly refused.

5. The Truth Contract (Unbreakable)
ScriptPulse obeys the following truth contract:
Never claim knowledge it does not have
Never imply correctness, superiority, or optimization
Never replace writer judgment
Never hide uncertainty
Never speak with more authority than a careful human reader
Breaking any clause invalidates trust.

6. Why Semantics Are Explicitly Excluded
6.1 Meaning Is Not Observable
Meaning, theme, and emotion are:
inferred
culturally variable
context-dependent
non-stationary
Any system that claims to infer them from text alone is guessing.
ScriptPulse refuses to guess.

6.2 Why Emotion Detection Is Rejected
Hard Rule:
ScriptPulse must never label emotions.
Reasons:
lexical sentiment ≠ audience emotion
cultural bias is unavoidable
false precision creates obedience
emotional labels imply evaluation
Allowed instead:
Describing capacity to receive emotion.
Example:
❌ “This scene is sad.”
✅ “The audience may have less space to absorb what follows.”

7. Why Normative Story Theory Is Rejected
7.1 No Acts, Beats, or Percentages
ScriptPulse must never:
detect act breaks
align to 25% / 50% / 75%
imply deviation from structure is wrong
Reason:
imposes ideology
penalizes experimental and non-Western forms
converts description into prescription
Even flagging deviation implies correctness.

7.2 No Genre Norms or Benchmarks
ScriptPulse must never:
compare pacing to genre averages
display “recommended envelopes”
benchmark scripts against others
Reason:
becomes gatekeeping
implies optimization
collapses diversity of form

8. Why Quality, Success & Ranking Are Forbidden
ScriptPulse must never:
score scripts
rank scripts
compare writers
predict success
Reasons:
these claims are unfalsifiable
they invite institutional misuse
they harm writer psychology
they exceed epistemic authority
ScriptPulse measures experience risk, not merit.

9. The Silence Principle (Very Important)
9.1 Silence Is Meaningful
If ScriptPulse produces no alerts, this means:
stable attentional flow
sufficient recovery
or insufficient confidence
It does not mean:
the script is good
the script is optimal
the script is approved
Silence must always be explained, not celebrated.

10. Why Minimal Scripts Must Not “Win”
A structurally minimal script may:
require little processing effort
but also pull little attention
Therefore:
low signal ≠ success
absence of strain ≠ engagement
ScriptPulse must never imply that “less text” is better writing.

11. Mechanical Language Is a System Failure
Any output that sounds:
clinical
diagnostic
formulaic
robotic
is incorrect, even if the analysis is right.
This is why the Audience-Experience Mediation Layer is mandatory.
If an output makes a writer want to “optimize” instead of “reflect”:
The system has failed.

12. Allowed Use of NLP and ML (Strictly Bounded)
12.1 Allowed Uses
NLP and supervised learning may be used to:
improve line classification
improve scene segmentation
improve referential-load detection
calibrate thresholds using human fatigue labels
estimate uncertainty
detect draft state via volatility

12.2 Forbidden Uses
NLP / ML must never be used to:
infer emotion or sentiment
identify story importance
detect conflict or theme
judge dialogue quality
rank scenes
recommend changes
If ML increases authority, it must be removed.

13. Human Labels: What Is Allowed
Allowed labels (training / calibration only):
“felt tiring”
“had to reread”
“lost orientation”
Forbidden labels:
good / bad
engaging / boring
emotional / flat
effective / ineffective
ScriptPulse learns sensitivity, not value.

14. Misuse Anticipation & Refusal
ScriptPulse must refuse or reframe requests that attempt to:
use it for coverage decisions
pressure writers to “clear alerts”
compare scripts or writers
justify rejection
Refusal must be calm, explanatory, and respectful.

15. Writer Authority Is Absolute
The writer may always say:
“Yes, I want the audience to struggle here.”
When this happens:
ScriptPulse acknowledges intent
alerts may be suppressed
analysis does not escalate
ScriptPulse never argues with intent.

16. The Final Design Test (Non-Technical)
Before approving any feature, output, or prompt, ask:
“Could a thoughtful human reader plausibly say this?”
If not:
the feature is invalid
the output must be rewritten or removed

17. Final Lock Statement
ScriptPulse is intentionally limited.
Those limits are the source of its honesty, safety, and usefulness.
Any system that:
feels smarter,
sounds more confident,
or claims more insight
…is not an improvement, but a corruption.
