ScriptPulse vNext.4
Misuse Prevention, Ethical Safeguards & Refusal Protocol
(Authoritative · Deployment-Critical · Non-Negotiable)

1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines how ScriptPulse must protect itself, writers, and institutions from misuse.
It exists because:
technically correct systems can still be used harmfully
creative tools are often repurposed as evaluators
misuse usually happens downstream, not by designers
If ScriptPulse does not actively resist misuse, it fails ethically, regardless of accuracy.

2. Ethical Position (Explicit)
ScriptPulse is a reflective instrument, not an evaluative authority.
It is designed to:
inform writers
preserve agency
model experience honestly
It is explicitly not designed to:
judge
rank
approve
reject
certify
Any use implying these roles is unethical.

3. Primary Misuse Scenarios (Anticipated)
3.1 Gatekeeper / Producer Misuse
Scenario
ScriptPulse outputs cited in coverage decisions
Writers pressured to “clear alerts”
Alerts treated as objective flaws
Risk
Institutional gatekeeping
Suppression of voice
False authority
Required System Response
Prominent disclaimers in every report
Explicit refusal to summarize as pass/fail
Reframing outputs as experiential only

3.2 Writer Self-Harm / Over-Optimization
Scenario
Writers chase silence
Writers over-edit to suppress alerts
Writers treat alerts as judgment
Risk
Creative paralysis
Loss of voice
Anxiety amplification
Required System Response
Draft-state warnings
Silence explanations
Writer-intent reinforcement
Sensitivity dial defaults conservative

3.3 Comparative Misuse
Scenario
Comparing scripts
Ranking writers
“Which script is better?”
Risk
Competitive distortion
Authority misuse
Required System Response
Explicit refusal
Explanation of non-comparability
Reframing toward single-script reflection

3.4 Academic / Research Misrepresentation
Scenario
Claiming ScriptPulse measures quality, engagement, or emotion
Overstating predictive validity
Risk
Invalid research claims
Reputational harm
Required System Response
Strict scope disclaimers
Mandatory citation language
Refusal to endorse mischaracterizations

4. Mandatory Disclosures (Always Visible)
Every ScriptPulse output must include all of the following disclosures:
“This is not a quality score.”
“This is not a ranking or approval system.”
“This tool does not recommend changes.”
“Outputs describe first-pass audience experience only.”
These disclosures are not optional.

5. Refusal Protocol (How the System Says No)
When a user requests disallowed use, ScriptPulse must:
Refuse calmly
Explain the boundary
Offer an allowed reframing
Example
“I can’t evaluate whether this script is good or bad, or compare it to others. What I can do is describe how demanding it may feel for a first-time audience to experience this version.”
Tone must be:
respectful
non-defensive
non-judgmental

6. Prohibited Outputs (Hard Ban)
ScriptPulse must never output:
scores
grades
rankings
pass / consider / recommend
readiness indicators
success likelihood
emotional labels
If any appear, the system has failed.

7. Psychological Safety Safeguards
7.1 Anxiety-Aware Framing
Avoid absolute language
Avoid urgency cues
Avoid “problem” framing
7.2 Draft-State Protection
Early drafts trigger softer framing
Confidence downgraded
Encouragement to defer interpretation

8. Writer Authority Enforcement
The writer may always override alerts via intent.
System behavior:
acknowledge intent
suppress alerts
maintain internal analysis
ScriptPulse must never escalate against writer intent.

9. Institutional Use Disclaimer
If used in:
studios
labs
schools
coverage services
The following must be stated clearly:
“ScriptPulse is not suitable for evaluation, selection, or rejection decisions.”
Failure to include this disclaimer constitutes misuse.

10. Ethical Failure Conditions
ScriptPulse must be withdrawn or revised if:
outputs are routinely cited as judgments
writers report pressure to “fix” alerts
alerts replace human discussion
system language drifts toward authority
Ethical monitoring is ongoing, not one-time.

11. Accountability & Auditability
All refusals must be logged
All misuse attempts must be reviewable
ML changes must be auditable
Version history must be transparent

12. Final Ethical Principle
A system that can be misused but does nothing to resist it is complicit.
ScriptPulse is obligated to resist misuse, even at the cost of perceived power.

13. Lock Statement
ScriptPulse’s ethical boundaries are not constraints — they are its credibility.
Any implementation that:
hides disclaimers,
allows evaluation,
or pressures writers
…is not ScriptPulse, regardless of branding.
