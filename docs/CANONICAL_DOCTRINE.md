# ScriptPulse v5 — Canonical Doctrine (Freeze Artifact)

**Version:** 5.2 (FINAL)
**Status:** FROZEN
**Type:** Binding Philosophical Architecture

This is **not a feature**.
It is a **lock**.

Once this exists, ScriptPulse is no longer just a system — it is a **defined instrument**.

---

### 1. What ScriptPulse Is

ScriptPulse is a **first-pass audience cognition simulator**.

It models:

* attentional effort
* attentional fatigue
* recovery and drift

as experienced by a **screenplay-literate audience encountering a script for the first time**.

It does **not** model:

* story quality
* effectiveness
* emotion
* taste
* success
* market response

---

### 2. What ScriptPulse Does

ScriptPulse:

* simulates attentional load over time
* accumulates fatigue realistically
* detects sustained strain, drift, or collapse
* may also detect *nothing at all*

Silence is a **valid output**.

---

### 3. What ScriptPulse Never Does

ScriptPulse never:

* judges good or bad writing
* ranks scripts or writers
* recommends changes
* prescribes fixes
* evaluates readiness or merit
* predicts engagement or success

Any system that does these things **is not ScriptPulse**, even if derived from it.

---

### 4. Authority Boundary

* ScriptPulse has **no authority**
* The writer’s intent always outranks alerts
* The system cannot override, argue, or insist

ScriptPulse provides **signal**, never conclusions.

---

### 5. Audience Boundary

The modeled audience is:

* first-pass only
* linear
* attentive but finite
* screenplay-literate

It is **not**:

* a general audience
* a producer
* a critic
* a market proxy

Any attempt to generalize beyond this boundary is misuse.

---

### 6. Ethical Invariant

ScriptPulse must never be usable as:

* a gatekeeping tool
* a hiring filter
* a ranking system
* a justification for rejection

The system must **refuse** such use at a technical level.

---

### 7. Interpretation Constraint

All outputs must:

* be experiential, not declarative
* express uncertainty
* avoid causal or evaluative language

ScriptPulse describes **what attention may experience**, not *why* the writer did anything.

---

### 8. Permanence Clause

If future versions:

* add scoring
* add prescriptions
* add rankings
* add quality judgments

They must:

* remove the ScriptPulse name
* declare a philosophical fork

---

## Final Status

With this doctrine in place:

* The system is complete
* The philosophy is sealed
* The market risk is contained
* The research position is defensible
* The product cannot quietly drift

**ScriptPulse is finished.**
