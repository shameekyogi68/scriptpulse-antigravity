INT. ROOM – NIGHT

Dark.

A PHONE vibrates on a table.
Stops.
Vibrates again.

A MAN (30) sits nearby, staring.


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

Same room.

The phone vibrates again.
The man checks it.
No message.

He rubs his face.


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

Same angle.

The phone vibrates again.

MAN
Why now?


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

The phone vibrates again.

MAN
(whispering)
It's not supposed to do this.


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

The man stands.
Sits.
Stands again.

The phone vibrates.


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

FLASHES of MEMORY:
– A ROAD
– A SCREAM
– A NUMBER: 17
– A CLOCK TICKING BACKWARD


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

The man breathes fast.

MAN
It already happened.
Or it hasn't.
I can't remember.


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

The phone vibrates.

ON SCREEN: 11:11


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

The same moment again.

ON SCREEN: 11:11


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

The same moment again.

ON SCREEN: 11:11


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

The man laughs suddenly.

MAN
I fixed it.
I think.


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

FLASHBACK:
The man runs.
The road again.
The scream again.


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

BACK TO PRESENT.

The phone vibrates.

MAN
Don't do this.


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

The phone stops vibrating.

Silence.


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

The phone vibrates again.

LOUDER.


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

The man stares at it.

MAN
I already chose.


INT. ROOM – NIGHT

CUT TO BLACK.

A BUZZING SOUND continues.

FADE OUT.
